# CTF Tools

You can find some tools I've developed for ctfs:
- [Multi process proxy](https://github.com/sandrulino01/ctf-tools/tree/main/http/multiprocess_proxy): a python script useful in A/D, allowing you to drop requests with malicious payloads
- [TEMP_NAME](https://github.com/sandrulino01/ctf-tools/tree/main/sql/TEMP_NAME/main.py): [STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT] a python script useful during some SQL Injections, making blind, error and time based injection easier to perform
